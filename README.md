# WorkoutcounterCPP
This repo standing alone has no significant importance.
This will be integrated with an android app that automatically counts workout's reps, for more information visit [Workoutcounter](https://github.com/anegm98/WorkoutCounter).
It takes a directory path of images and create a profile of unique images based on change of angle of motion between ordered images

### How to run

> cmake .

> make

> ./DisplayImage path/to/ordered/images/by/name/

##### it only makes sense when the input is sequence of images of moving object
